# Lariat Rental Car Company Analysis
In this project I examined and cleaned historical sales data from a rental car complany Lariat rent-a-car using Excel (Vlookup, pivot tables, and t-tests). I completed EDA to identify different strategies assessed by KPI performance to provide recommendations on how to maximize their profit margins and minimize operational costs.  

In addition, the Excel file includes interactive dashboards that show the profitability of a particular branch in a given state and make/model compared to the national average. I also came up with a condensed PPT presentation that highlights the pros/cons of the different stratgies.
